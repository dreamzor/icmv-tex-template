# icmv-tex-template
TeX template for ICMV conference (originally prepared for ICMV 2015). 

It has **NOT YET** verified by ICMV reviewers as correct.

A compiled .pdf example is here: https://github.com/dreamzor/icmv-tex-template/blob/master/icmv_tex_template.pdf

Style files `spie.cls` and `spiebib.bst` are copied from https://github.com/bollig/LatexTemplates/tree/master/journal and slightly changed.
